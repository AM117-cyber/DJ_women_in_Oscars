Give me a code that given a json file with the following structure: year:{ category:{ subcategory:{ information_of_subcategory}}} only modifies the subcategories  inside the category: program. Each of these subcategories  will now have the format: subcategory: {staff_name:{name_of_work: "work"
              winner: true or false}}. The subcategories are currently in the format: subcategory: name_of_work\n(winner or nominee)\nstaff_information                  In winner or nominee if it says Winner then winner is true, otherwise it's false. In staff information only extract the lines that begin exactly with: staff_lines_to_keep = ['Produced by', 'Co-Produced by', 'Executive Producer:', 'Produced in association with', 'Presenting the production by', 'Consulting Producer:', 'This production was originally produced and presented in July 2012 by', 'Originally produced by', 'Originally produced in July 2001 by']
